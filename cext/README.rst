Simple Python native access library for Video4Linux camera devices
==================================================================

*Warning*: Work (slowly) in progress. Currently hardwired to YUV format.
This will be fixed soon

This is a simple library that allows one to access camera devices
accessible via Video4Linux from Python without using libraries with huge
dependency chains that allows easy and fast testing of ideas and
algorithms for image processing before implementing them in a proper way
in some programming language such as C. Itâ€™s built in the most simple
way on purpose.

Tested on:

-  Python 3.8:

   -  FreeBSD 12 (amd64, aarch64)
   -  FreeBSD 13 (amd64, aarch64)

Currently not implemented / not optimal
---------------------------------------

-  Currently the library does not support anything else than YUV422
   captures from the cameras and only outputs RGB888 images as nested
   Python lists. This will be fixed as soon as possible but will
   introduce a breaking change.

Installing via PyPi
===================

Note that you have to install some native packages on FreeBSD before
building the extension. Those are:

-  ``multimedia/v4l_compat``
-  ``multimedia/webcamd``

To install and start the required services:

::

   pkg install multimedia/v4l_compat multimedia/webcamd
   echo "webcamd_enable=\"YES\"" >> /etc/rc.conf
   echo "cuse_load=\"YES\"" >> /boot/loader.conf
   kldload cuse
   /etc/rc.d/devd restart
   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/webcamd start

The package is available as a source distribution via PyPi:

::

   pip install simplepycam-tspspi

Building
========

Use ``setup.py`` in ``cext``:

::

   $ python setup.py build

Example usage
=============

More sophisticated examples can be found in the ``samples`` directory.

Using the stream callback interface, the default format and with
----------------------------------------------------------------

::

   import simplepycam

   def processFrame(camera, frame):
       if shouldStopProcessing:
           return False
       else:
           return True

   with simplepycam.Camera("/dev/video0") as cam:
       cam.frameCallback = [ processFrame ]
       cam.stream()

Using the stream callback interface, the default format and open/close
----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

   import simplepycam

   def processFrame(camera, frame):
       if shouldStopProcessing:
           return False
       else:
           return True

   cam = simplepycam.Camera("/dev/video0")
   cam.open()
   cam.frameCallback = [ processFrame ]
   cam.stream()
   cam.close()

Using the polling API, the default format and with
--------------------------------------------------

::

   import simplepycam

   with simplepycam.Camera("/dev/video0") as cam:
       cam.streamOn()
       for i in range(100):
           frame = cam.nextFrame()
       cam.streamOff()

Using the polling API, the default format and open/close
--------------------------------------------------------

::

   import simplepycam

   cam = simplepycam.Camera("/dev/video0")
   cam.open()
   cam.streamOn()
   for i in range(100):
       frame = cam.nextFrame()
   cam.streamOff()
   cam.close()
